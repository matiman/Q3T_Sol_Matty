My name is **Mathias Abdissa (Matty)** and I am a backend developer with 7 years experience working in Financial, Education, Realestate and, Ecommerce industry, and 3 years running my own startups. Currently fully focused on building on Solana with Anchor, Rust, and Typescript.

This repo is for all Solana development work done while being enrolled at Turbin3.com in Q4 2024, one of the leading solana education providers and #1 recommended by Solana Foundation.

Here you will find all course projects and my own current project, DevLoot.

- [Dev Loot](https://github.com/matiman/Q3T_Sol_Matty/tree/main/capstone_DevLoot): DevLoot is an **interactive** platform that allows engineers to learn Solana development with **visual aids and execution environment** on the browser so they can **learn by doing.**
